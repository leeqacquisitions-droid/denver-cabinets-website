The Problems (Fix this)

1. The "Brand Clash" in the Header (Critical)

What I see: You have the old "Estate Solutions" logo (the blue house icon) sitting right next to the new "DENVER. Cabinets" text.

Why it fails: It looks confused. Is the company Estate Solutions or Denver Cabinets? High-end brands are confident. They don't clutter the header.

The Fix: Remove the image logo entirely from the header.

Let the text "DENVER. Cabinets" be the only logo. It is cleaner, more modern, and looks like a design studio.

Move the "Estate Solutions" legal name/logo to the Footer.

2. The White Header Bar

What I see: A solid white bar at the top with a dark hero section below it.

Why it fails: This feels like a standard "template." It creates a hard line that ruins the cinematic immersion.

The Fix: Glassmorphism (Transparency).

The header should be bg-transparent (transparent) when at the top of the page, so the dark hero image bleeds all the way to the top edge.

It should only turn into a solid color (preferably Dark Slate, not White) after the user scrolls down.

3. The Button Hierarchy

What I see: A bright green "CALL" pill in the header, a Blue "View Portfolio" button, and an Outline "Schedule" button.

Why it fails: Too many colors fighting.

The Fix: Simplify the palette.

Header Button: Make it a "Ghost" button (transparent with white text) or the Emerald Pulse we discussed.

Hero Primary Button: Keep the "Schedule a Free Measure" as the main colored button (Blue Gradient).

Secondary Button: "View Portfolio" should be the outline/subtle one. Prioritize the lead (the measure) over the browsing (the portfolio).

Action Plan

Tell Cyborg (or apply these changes) to refine the header. Here is the specific direction:

"Update the Header component:

Remove the img tag for the Estate Solutions logo. Keep only the text 'DENVER. Cabinets'.

Change the Header background to be transparent (absolute position) on top of the Hero image, not a solid white block.

When scrolling, make the header background bg-slate-950/90 (Dark) instead of white, so it matches the dark theme."
