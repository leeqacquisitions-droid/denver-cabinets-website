1️⃣ Priority Order (what to polish next)
Given how the site looks right now, I’d hit things in this order:
Light Sections Harmonization Pack
(Process, Materials, Best Sellers, FAQ – unify card style + background)
Reviews & Testimonials Spotlight Pack
(make those human photos feel intentional and premium)
Footer Cohesion Pack
(make footer match new dark header/hero energy, but keep client blue)
If you do just those three, the whole site will feel like one continuous, upgraded design.
2️⃣ Light Sections Harmonization Pack
(Process / Materials / Best Sellers / FAQ)
Right now each of these uses its own card/border/shadow recipe.
We want them to share one “Estate Card” style that matches the new portfolio cards.
a) Define a shared card style
Tell Cyborg to create a common class / component (mentally):
// pseudo-class via Tailwind utilities
const estateCard =
  "rounded-3xl bg-slate-900/70 border border-slate-800/80 shadow-[0_22px_60px_rgba(15,23,42,0.85)]";
For light sections where full dark is too much, use:
const estateCardLight =
  "rounded-3xl bg-slate-900/2 border border-slate-200/70 shadow-[0_18px_40px_rgba(15,23,42,0.06)]";
Then:
Process cards → estateCardLight
Materials cards → estateCardLight
Best sellers door cards → estateCardLight + stronger hover
FAQ items → no more “flat white strips”; wrap each Q/A row in a soft estateCardLight with divide-y on the inside
This will instantly make all those sections feel like they belong to the same design family as the portfolio.
b) Background for those sections
Right now: hard white.
Shift each of these sections to a very soft warm background:
<section className="bg-[#F5F4F2] py-16">
or Tailwind:
bg-slate-50 is okay,
bg-zinc-50 even nicer.
The key: no more pure white slabs. It’ll look more architectural.
c) Headings
Make sure all these headings use the exact same treatment the hero and portfolio are using:
text-slate-900
tracking-tight
text-3xl md:text-4xl
same margin-bottom pattern.
Right now some headings are a little looser; we just tighten to match.
3️⃣ Reviews & Testimonials Spotlight Pack
The “Client Reviews” photo and the little black chat-style form are powerful, but visually under-framed.
Upgrade pattern:
Wrap the big review photo in the same card style as portfolio:
rounded-3xl
shadow-[0_22px_60px_rgba(15,23,42,0.85)]
slight border
Add a small strip above the photo:
“Homeowner review – Denver, CO”
4.8 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ on BBB / word-of-mouth (if true / safe to say)
Put the black “What’s your name?” chat box in its own section, full width,
and give the whole section a darker background (bg-slate-950/95) so it feels like a focused contact moment, not a random insert.
This keeps everything you already built, just frames it better.
4️⃣ Footer Cohesion Pack
Footer is still the old strong blue slab; header/hero are now dark navy-slate with green call chip.
Simple way to harmonize without scaring the client:
Top footer row:
bg-slate-950 or bg-slate-950/95
white text
links, contact, newsletter all in a clean 3- or 4-column grid.
Bottom bar (thin strip):
use the client’s blue as an accent: bg-[#3346CC] (whatever exact Get Quote button color is)
include copyright + BBB badge down there.
That way their blue becomes a brand accent bar, not a huge wall of color.
5️⃣ What to Actually Tell Cyborg
If you want to move this forward today, you can literally say to Cyborg:
“Use Charles’ ‘Estate Card’ style to unify the Process, Materials, Best Sellers, and FAQ sections.
Then apply his footer cohesion notes: dark top footer, brand-blue bottom bar with BBB + copyright.”
And then:
“Next, upgrade the Reviews section so the homeowner photo and chat-style form feel like intentional, premium testimonial blocks, using the same card and background rules.”
That will get you 90% of the remaining polish.
